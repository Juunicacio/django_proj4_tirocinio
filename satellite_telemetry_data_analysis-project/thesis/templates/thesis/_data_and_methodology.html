    <h3 class="main_heading">2.1 Access to the Raw data and Understanding the Data</h3>
    <!-- say about the name of the project and it is goind to work with 4 turtles -->
    <p class="main_text">The first step of the work consisted in comprehend the single source file "Tag 710333A 20 Sept.xlsx" provided by Telonics and furnished me by Professor P. Luschi. <!--for the first observation of the data and analyse which type of information it provides.--></p>
    <p class="main_text">That raw file data represents a wildlife tracking data, specifically of an individual of Adult Mediterranean Loggerhead Sea Turtle Female, tracked continuously by satellite telemetry and comprises substantially informations of GPS, Dive and Transmitter Temperature Monitoring, collected in a period between July 9, 2020 and September 21, 2020.</p>				

    <h3 class="main_heading">2.2 Turtle Geolocation using GIS application</h3>
    <p class="main_text"> As the main aspiration of this project is analysing and answering questions about the presence of that turtle individual in space and time on a Global Positioning System, and being presented with coordinates data, the first step to effectively examine the recorded GPS position points, estimated by the satellite systems, required the use of a geographic visualization tool.</p>

    <h3 class="main_heading">2.3 Dealing with Uncertain data</h3>
    <p class="main_text">Examining the GPS records into "QGIS" and visually detecting faulty location points; led us to discuss how deleting those uncertain GPS points manually, not considering filtering them by using a estimated parameter or a statistical justification, could impact the data veracity. Furthermore, impacting any update and increasement of the dataset with further collected locations in time, likewise impacting a different turtle track dataset within the same project. 
    <p class="main_text">All individual turtles database information related to the same project, required the same parameter definitions as a tool of data quality assurance. "Uncertainty can impact big data, both in terms of analytics and the dataset itself {37}". To prevent affecting data veracity, when filtering uncertain GPS points, a standardized parameter to evaluate reliable data was established.</p>

    <p class="main_text">When data is unertain, it may be plausible to just delete it, however, in this project, uncertain data will be filtered out from reliable data to a distinct dataset, and equally utilised as measurement for the satellite telemetry system performance analysis.</p>					

    <p class="main_text">To implement the standardized parameter, clean the data and filter reliable GPS from uncertain GPS in an automation way, a use of a programming language was required. "Means of providing automation is the use of an object-oriented approach to project implementation, a standard set of tools for providing processes for building and debugging programs, connecting auxiliary libraries for the programming language used" {39}. The programming language introduced in this project to an automated analysis is "Python".</p>

    <h3 class="main_heading">3.1 Cleaning data with Python</h3>
    <p class="main_text">To evaluate GPS data on the accurate data entry, <!--evaluating reliable GPS data,--> the standardization method established was the use of a velocity limit filter as parameter that could deliver reasonably reliable results for GPS position points, since the velocity between sequence points do not surpases 4km/h.<!--

        Calculate velocity and errors from distance between GPS points

            I computed the distance between GPS points (Using Geodesic distance and Vincenty formula) and, since the timestamp information is known, the time difference between the points can be used to calculate the time delta. Since, we now have the distance and the time delta between the points, we can calculate the velocity (= distance between points/time delta) which could then be also used as a measurement input to the Kalman. {link}

            Speed (or rate, r) is a scalar quantity that measures the distance traveled (d) over the change in time (Δt), represented by the equation r = d/Δt.
            The most common formula for average speed is distance traveled divided by time taken.

    Interpreting your findings is about seeing whether what you found confirms or does not confirm the findings of previous studies in your literature review.
    to look for meaning that can serve as evidence. Often scientists seek to determine whether variables are related and how much they are related.
    you can conclude that your observation is statistically significant.
    This means that the results are considered to be „statistically non-significant‟ if the analysis shows that differences as large as (or larger than) the observed difference would be expected to occur by chance more than one out of twenty times
    Data interpretation is the process of reviewing data through some predefined processes which will help assign some meaning to the data and arrive at a relevant conclusion
